- It is possible to insert textual code directly into the model. But as these are only text fields (no code-completion, ...) this feature is not used.
  - The solution are user code areas that will be filled in with e.g. vs-code
  - These areas stay untouched by the code generation.
  - The generated code including changes by hand must be commited as well.
