Model Documentation
=======================
This document provides supplementary information about the model,
not directly documented within the model itself.

Modeling Language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SysML is used as modeling language.
In contrast to UML it allows a hollsitic view on the system and is more suitable for systems engineering.

Modeling Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MWP (MBSE with Papyrus) is used as modeling framework and is made for Papyrus.
There is also a book: `Model-Based Systems Engineering with Papyrus <https://mbse4u.com/books/mbse-with-sysml-and-eclipse-papyrus/>`_.
But where necessary and useful, the framework may be broken. (see: TBD)

TODO: There exists an MWP package the book uses. Do we use it as well? (see the link of the book)
